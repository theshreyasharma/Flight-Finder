## CS 225 Final Project 
Developed for UIUC CS 225 Data Structures Final Project. The goal of this project is to detect the shortest flight path from a start point to an end point. To accomplish this, we created a randomized graph of airport nodes that have the distances as edge weights. To compute these edge weights, we used the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula). Additionally, we were able to detect the shortest flight path between two points when given a point that must be visited in between. Our project incorporated Breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and the Landmark path algorithm.

## Installation
Clone this repository into your desired location `git clone https://github.com/theshreyasharma/Flight-Finder.git`

## Build and Run
In order to build and run our executable, run the command `make final` followed by `./final`. Note: Running `make final` and `./final` will run using default airports that we have determined. For further use, change the airports that are being used by picking an airports from the `openflightsformatted.csv` and replace under the comment section for which algorithm to run in main. Because of random creation of edges, some dijkstras implementations will lead to no path found. In this case no airports will be written to the text file and "No Path" will be written to terminal. Then, check the files `bfs.txt`, `landmarkpath.txt`, and `dijkstra.txt` to view the output of the traversal and both algorithms. If you would like to change the origin and/or destination of any traversal or algorithm, you should replace our sample input airports with your own in `main.cpp` then run as indicated. Furthemore, running `make test` then `./test` will produce the output of our sample unit tests.

## Credits
We utilized the [Open Flights](https://openflights.org/data.html) dataset for this project. The Graph class, Edge class, Random class, as well as the cs225 folder were taken from lab_ml.
The DijkstraPair and Compare struct in `dijkstras.cpp` were derived from [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stl-priority-queue-for-structure-or-class/).
